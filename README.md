# Future Plans for the project:
Apply Adimin ( Owner ) Authentication which only the shop owner can access, and the salesman would have other authentication.
Admin would be allowed for all the operations.
Salesman would be only allowed to generate bills.
On the mobile we would be showing some more details like analytics how much sale happened in this month compared to last and else.
